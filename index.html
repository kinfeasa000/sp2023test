  <h1>My favorite movie</h1>
  <caption><h2> Hacksaw Ridge </h2></caption>
  <p> Hacksaw ridge is my favorite movie because it has a lot of action and it is also a true story.<br>
    The fact that the story is true is so inspirational to me. The movie starts out with a young man 
    named Desmond Doson  in his early 20s putting his belt around a boy that fell and broke his leg. 
    He goes to the hospital to get his belt back and meets his future wife who is a nurse. The date for 
    some time but then the war started and he had to enlist, he couldn’t stay home and watch everyone as 
    they left home to protect the country and his father is a former soldier. So Desmond enlist goes through 
    all the training but he refused to touch a gun, this made his superiors and his unit angry. His unit beat 
    him up in his sleep and his superiors tried to dishonorably discharge him. Desomnd argued that he doesn’t 
    need to carry a gun, he can train as a medic and save lives instead of taking them. After some time the army 
    allowed him to serve and his unit shipped out. They went to a place called Hacksaw ridge, they fought and beat 
    the vietnamese soldiers and took the high ground they slept there that night but the next day the enemy had a 
    surprise attack from tunnels underground. The attack forced them to retreat back but so many of them were injured 
    and Desmond refused to retreat that day he saved 70 people from the ridge including his superior officer and some of his unit.
